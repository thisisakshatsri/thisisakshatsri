# Hi, I'm Akshat.

I'm an Computer Application student at Harcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur(India). As a passionate developer, I focus on driving innovative outcomes by getting involved in diverse communities with an emphasis on clean and maintainable code. My past personal projects apply technologies including AWS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Databases, etc., and are open-sourced at GitHub.

I like to read about almost anything, aspire to open-ended conversations and tinker with the latest technologies to find efficient ways to solve problems.
